### `define-flow-type`

> @deprecated rule that is no longer needed with the current recommended config but kept around in case people want to continue using it with `@babel/eslint-parser` such as the `babel-parser` extension.

Marks Flow type identifiers as defined.

Used to suppress [`no-undef`](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-undef) reporting of type identifiers.
