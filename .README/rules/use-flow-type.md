### `use-flow-type`

> @deprecated rule that is no longer needed with the current recommended config but kept around in case people want to continue using it with `@babel/eslint-parser` such as the `babel-parser` extension.

Marks Flow [type alias](https://flowtype.org/docs/type-aliases.html) declarations as used.

Used to suppress [`no-unused-vars`](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-unused-vars) errors that are triggered by type aliases.
